# WebServer & Client
Simple WebServer with an Web-UI



•	To run Application 1 (ChatClient / WebClient): open the solution and run it

•	if you want to open multiple instances: go to the executable application („ChatClient\bin\Debug\ChatClient.exe“) and start as many as you like

•	for Application 2 (WebServer): open the solution, run it and go into your browser and go to http://localhost:7296/

•	Application 2 receives all messages and broadcasts to all clients

•	Application 1 only receives messages from the server and can send message to the server

If you come across any errors please feel free to contact me. Mrs Kleint should have my e-mail and phone number. The port for the web server is hard coded at the moment.

Greetings, Nico
